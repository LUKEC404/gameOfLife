# Game of Life

This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway.  
The game is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.  
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states: alive or dead.  
Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click on cells to toggle their state between alive and dead.
- **Start/Stop Simulation**: Control the simulation with start and stop buttons.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Modify the speed of the simulation to observe different behaviors.
- **Responsive Design**: Compatible with various screen sizes for optimal user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Game logic and interactivity.
- **p5.js**: Library for rendering graphics and handling animations.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LukeCullen123/gameOfLife.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd gameOfLife
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser**.

   You can do this by double-clicking the `index.html` file or by running:

   ```bash
   open index.html  # For macOS
   # or
   start index.html  # For Windows
   ```

## Usage

- **Initialize the Grid**: Click on cells to set up the initial configuration.
- **Start the Simulation**: Press the "Start" button to begin the simulation.
- **Pause the Simulation**: Press the "Stop" button to pause.
- **Reset the Grid**: Refresh the page to clear the grid and set up a new initial state.
